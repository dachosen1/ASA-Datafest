# ASA-Datafest

I had the opportunity to Participate in Columbia Universities ASA Data, and our team came in 2nd place. I created this repository to share our approach. 


### The Challenge

The Canadian National Women's Rugby Team seeks your advice on the role of workload and fatigue in Rugby 7s. Rugby 7s is a fast-paced, 
physically demanding sport that pushes the limits of athlete speed, endurance and toughness. Rugby 7s players may play in up to three games
in a day, resulting in a tremendous amount of athletic exertion. Substantial exertion results in fatigue, which may lead to physiological 
deficits (e.g., dehydration), reduced athletic performance, and greater risk of injury.

Despite the importance of managing player fatigue in professional athletics, very little is known about its effects, and many training 
decisions are based on “gut feel.”  Currently, training load is measured through a combination of subjective measurements (asking players 
how hard they worked) and objective measurements from wearable technology. Fatigue is typically estimated by asking players how they feel 
in wellness surveys. However, there is no agreed-upon standard of defining fatigue so the relationship between workload and fatigue is 
unclear. In this challenge, we encourage you to explore new ways of measuring fatigue and examine its effects on players’ performance and
 physical wellness. The datasets provide a number of observations that we believe will be useful to measure fatigue in players of the
 Canadian National Women's Rugby Team in the 2017-2018 season. Remember that training load is not the same as fatigue, and one question 
 to explore is whether you can find evidence that some measures of training load are better than others.
